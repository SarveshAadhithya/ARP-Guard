ARP Guard
ARP Guard is a Python-based network security tool that protects against ARP spoofing attacks. ARP spoofing is a common attack technique where an attacker sends fake ARP messages to a network in order to associate their MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device on the network. Once the attacker has successfully spoofed the ARP tables on the network, they can intercept or modify network traffic, steal sensitive information, or launch other attacks.

ARP Guard works by monitoring ARP traffic on the network and alerting users when it detects a potential ARP spoofing attack. The app can also automatically block or drop suspicious traffic to prevent attacks from succeeding.
